# Ruler of the Plane

Our game is called LinesIntersection, and our game files can be found in 
unity\Assets\LinesIntersection and unity\Scripts\LinesIntersection

We added a LinesController, LinesPoints, LinesSegments, and LinesLevel script in the Scripts directory.
We added a Game, Menu and victory scene in the LinesIntersection/Scenes directory.

We have not yet gotten around to planning how the algorithms and the datastructures will be implemented, as setting up Unity took more time than expected.
